# Recipe-Roulette

## Description 
Recipe Roulette is dedicated to the home cooks looking to expand their recipe books and discover unique cuisines. This app was inspired to help those who desire something different for dinner. If you have an ingredient at home and do not have a clue what to make this app is for you. For instances, if your main dish will include chicken simply type "chicken" into the input field and an array of images corresponding to recipes will appear. Each image has a button that will redirect the user to the recipe source. Feeling like having a dish from a different part of the world? User may choose to filter each recipe by cuisine type along with their desired ingredient.

## Challenges 
One of our challenges in creating this app was finding a way to display recipe images to user in a presentable manner. Using Materialize CSS slider effect we were able to present all available search results at once; however, we were left with the issue of image quality and multiplying slider icons as shown below. Another obstacle we encountered was finding a recipe API capable of returning cuisine types. In this app Spoonacular is being used however there is a limit to the amount of request that can be made. Lastly, if a recipe is no longer available on the host site app currently does not indicate the error. 

### Recipe unavailable and slider icon defect
